## Original Prompt

> Review the offline support proposal for Zenote, a wabi-sabi note-taking app. Evaluate how the offline experience should align with Zen philosophy and wabi-sabi design principles.

## Philosophy: The Uncarved Block (朴 Pu)

In Zen, there's a concept of the "uncarved block" — the idea that the natural state is the ideal state. Most apps treat offline as a *problem to solve*. For Zenote, offline should feel like the **natural state** — you're simply writing, and the cloud is a gentle companion, not a dependency.

## 1. Communicating Offline State: The Weather Approach

**Reject:** Banners, toast notifications, warning icons, red badges
**Embrace:** Atmospheric shifts, like weather changing outside your window

### Recommendation: "Quiet Sky" Indicator

Instead of announcing offline status, **subtly shift the atmosphere**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ONLINE STATE                           │
│  • Paper texture: full warmth           │
│  • No indicator needed (absence = peace)│
│                                         │
│  OFFLINE STATE                          │
│  • Paper texture: slightly cooler       │
│  • Subtle cloud watermark in corner     │
│  • Like fog on a mountain — natural     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation concept:**
- A tiny ink-wash cloud (雲) icon in the header, barely there
- Opacity: 0.3 — visible if you look, invisible if you don't
- No animation, no pulse — just quiet presence
- Tooltip on hover: "Writing locally. Will sync when the path clears."

**Why this works:** The user isn't *warned* about offline — they're gently *aware*, like noticing the light has changed outside.

---

## 2. Sync Conflicts: Kintsugi Resolution

**Reject:** Error modals, red warnings, "CONFLICT DETECTED"
**Embrace:** Two versions as two brushstrokes — both valid

### Recommendation: "Two Paths" View

When a conflict occurs, present it as a **contemplative choice**, not an emergency:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                             │
│   Two versions of this thought exist.                       │
│   Which feels truer?                                        │
│                                                             │
│   ┌─────────────────────┐   ┌─────────────────────┐        │
│   │ Written here        │   │ Written elsewhere   │        │
│   │ Yesterday, 3:42 PM  │   │ Yesterday, 4:15 PM  │        │
│   │                     │   │                     │        │
│   │ "The morning light  │   │ "The morning light  │        │
│   │  felt different..." │   │  reminded me of..." │        │
│   │                     │   │                     │        │
│   │     [Keep this]     │   │     [Keep this]     │        │
│   └─────────────────────┘   └─────────────────────┘        │
│                                                             │
│                    [Keep both as separate notes]            │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Design details:**
- Soft serif typography for the question
- Cards at equal visual weight (no "winner")
- Timestamps in gentle tertiary text
- No red, no yellow — use existing warm palette
- "Keep both" option honors the wabi-sabi acceptance of multiplicity

**After resolution:** A subtle gold line (金継ぎ kintsugi) appears briefly at the note's edge, then fades — celebrating the repair rather than hiding it.

---

## 3. Pending Changes: The Ink Stone (硯 Suzuri)

**Reject:** Queue counters, "3 changes pending", progress bars
**Embrace:** Subtle mark of ongoing work, like ink drying

### Recommendation: "Drying Ink" Indicator

Show pending changes as **ink that hasn't fully dried** — present but not anxious:

```
SAVED STATE:           PENDING STATE:
┌──────────────┐       ┌──────────────┐
│ Note Title   │       │ Note Title · │  ← tiny ink dot
│              │       │              │
│ Content...   │       │ Content...   │
└──────────────┘       └──────────────┘
```

**Implementation:**
- A single ink dot (・) after the title in the note card
- Color: `var(--color-text-tertiary)` at 60% opacity
- No count, no queue — just "something is settling"
- Disappears with a 300ms fade when synced

**Why this works:**
- Transparency without anxiety
- Like seeing wet ink — you know to be gentle, but it's not alarming
- Honest but quiet

---

## 4. Mental Model: Local-First (Your Notebook, Your Desk)

**Recommendation:** Frame Zenote as a **personal notebook that occasionally shares**, not cloud software that caches.

### Language shifts:

| Cloud-First (Avoid) | Local-First (Embrace) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| "Syncing to cloud..." | "Sharing your thoughts..." |
| "Offline mode" | "Writing locally" |
| "Upload failed" | "Will share when ready" |
| "Sync conflict" | "Two versions exist" |
| "Connected" | (No indicator — silence is connection) |

### Why local-first is more wabi-sabi:
- Your journal is *yours*, not borrowed from the cloud
- The app works without permission from a server
- Sync is generosity (sharing), not dependency (requiring)
- Aligns with the intimate, personal journal aesthetic

---

## 5. Micro-Interactions: Breath and Flow

### The Breath Principle
All loading/syncing animations should follow **natural breath rhythm**:
- Inhale (ease-in): 0.3s
- Hold: 0.1s
- Exhale (ease-out): 0.5s
- Rest: 0.2s

Total cycle: ~1.1s — matches calm breathing

### Specific Patterns:

**Syncing animation:**
```css
@keyframes ink-diffuse {
  0% { opacity: 0.4; transform: scale(1); }
  50% { opacity: 0.6; transform: scale(1.02); }
  100% { opacity: 0.4; transform: scale(1); }
}
```
Like ink slowly spreading on wet paper — organic, not mechanical.

**Reconnection moment:**
- No celebration, no checkmark
- Simply: the cloud icon fades away over 2 seconds
- Absence of indicator *is* the success state
- "Ma" (間) — the meaningful pause

**Conflict resolution complete:**
- Brief gold shimmer along the note edge (0.5s)
- References kintsugi without being literal
- Then: nothing. Peace restored.

## Summary: The Zen Offline Manifesto

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Silence is connection** | No indicator when online — absence is peace |
| **Weather, not warnings** | Offline shown as atmospheric shift, not alert |
| **Two paths, not conflicts** | Present versions as choices, not errors |
| **Ink drying, not queuing** | Pending changes as subtle dots, not counters |
| **Local is home** | Cloud syncs *to* you, not you *to* cloud |
| **Breath, not spin** | Animations follow natural rhythm |
| **Kintsugi celebration** | Repairs shown with gold, then released |

## Final Thought

> "The usefulness of a pot comes from its emptiness."
> — Lao Tzu

The power of Zenote's offline experience should come from what it *doesn't* show. The absence of sync indicators, the lack of progress bars, the silence of successful connection — these create space for what matters: the writing itself.

## Technical Complexity Assessment

### Required Components

| Component | Complexity | Effort | Description |
|-----------|------------|--------|-------------|
| PWA Manifest | Low | 1-2 hrs | manifest.json, icons, installability |
| Service Worker | Medium | 4-6 hrs | Cache static assets (Vite PWA plugin) |
| IndexedDB Storage | Medium | 6-8 hrs | Local DB via Dexie.js, mirror schema |
| Offline Queue | Medium-High | 8-12 hrs | Queue mutations, retry on reconnect |
| Sync Engine | HIGH | 16-24 hrs | Conflict resolution, merge strategy |
| Zen UI Indicators | Low-Medium | 4-6 hrs | Subtle states per design above |

### Estimated Total: 4-7 days
