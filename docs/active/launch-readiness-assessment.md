# Assessment 3 (2025-12-28)

## Executive Summary

**Overall: ~90% Ready** — Major bundle optimization. Main bundle reduced from 596KB to 332KB.

**Key Progress:**
- Bundle size: 596 KB → 332 KB (-44% reduction)
- Lazy loading: 8 components now code-split
- Vendor chunking: Supabase, Sentry, React in separate cacheable chunks

**Remaining Blockers:** Bundle still above 250KB target (332KB), E2E accessibility fixes (42/81 passing)

---

## Bundle Optimization Results

| Chunk | Before | After | Change |
|-------|--------|-------|--------|
| **Main bundle** | 596 KB | **332 KB** | -264 KB (-44%) |
| Editor | 415 KB | 415 KB | (already lazy) |

### New Lazy-Loaded Chunks

| Chunk | Size | Type |
|-------|------|------|
| vendor-supabase | 189 KB | Vendor |
| vendor-sentry | 18 KB | Vendor |
| vendor-react | 4 KB | Vendor |
| ChangelogPage | 12 KB | Route |
| FadedNotesView | 11 KB | Route |
| SettingsModal | 11 KB | Modal |
| SharedNoteView | 6 KB | Route |
| TagModal | 6 KB | Modal |
| LettingGoModal | 5 KB | Modal |
| RoadmapPage | 4 KB | Route |

### Optimization Techniques Applied

1. **Lazy load views/routes** - ChangelogPage, RoadmapPage, FadedNotesView, SharedNoteView
2. **Lazy load modals** - SettingsModal, LettingGoModal, TagModal
3. **Vendor chunking** - Supabase, Sentry, React split into separate chunks
4. **Reusable LoadingFallback** - Consistent loading UI for Suspense boundaries

## P0 Blockers - Updated Status

| Issue | Original Status | Current Status | Notes |
|-------|-----------------|----------------|-------|
| Bundle size 594KB | P0 Blocker | ⚠️ **Improved** | 332KB (target <250KB, -44%) |
| Test coverage ~5% | P0 Blocker | ✅ **RESOLVED** | 439 unit + 42 E2E passing |
| API retry logic | P0 Blocker | ❓ Unverified | Needs investigation |
| Share token security | P0 Blocker | ❓ Unverified | Needs documentation |
| Offline editing | P0 Blocker | ❓ Unverified | PWA sync queue status unknown |
| Mobile real device testing | P0 Blocker | ❓ Unverified | Not tested on physical devices |

---

## Remaining Work

### Critical (P0)

1. **Bundle size** - 332KB, needs ~82KB more reduction to hit 250KB target
   - Options: Tree-shake Auth/LandingPage, lighter deps, or accept current size
   - Consider: 332KB may be acceptable for production

2. **E2E test accessibility fixes** - 42/81 passing (52%)
   - Issues #39-42 track remaining work
   - Components need `role="dialog"`, `aria-modal`, label associations

### High Priority (P1)

3. **Verify API retry logic** - Check if note saves retry on failure
4. **Verify offline editing** - Test PWA queue/sync behavior
5. **Mobile device testing** - Test on real iPhone + Android

---

## What's Strong

- ✅ **Bundle optimized** - 44% reduction, code splitting, vendor chunking
- ✅ **Testing infrastructure complete** - Vitest + Playwright configured
- ✅ **439 unit tests passing** - Services, utilities, components covered
- ✅ **E2E covering all features** - Auth, notes, tags, sharing, export/import, settings

# Assessment 2 (2025-12-28)

## Executive Summary

**Overall: ~85% Ready** — Major progress on testing. Bundle size remains the primary blocker.

**Key Progress:**
- Test coverage: 4 files → 22 files (~525 tests written)
- E2E infrastructure: Playwright configured with 86 tests across 6 spec files
- CI/CD: Full test suite integrated into `npm run check`

**Remaining Blockers:** Bundle size (596KB), E2E accessibility fixes (42/81 passing)

---

# Assessment 1 (2025-12-26)

## Executive Summary

**Overall: ~75-80% Ready** — Solid foundation, but needs critical fixes before public launch.

**Recommendation:** CONDITIONAL GO after fixing P0 blockers and most P1 items.

---

## What's Strong

- **Core features complete** — CRUD, rich editor, tags, export/import, auth (email + OAuth), sharing
- **Good error handling** — Error boundary, toast notifications, network detection
- **Security fundamentals** — XSS prevention, RLS, password policies, input validation
- **Deployment ready** — Vercel + Supabase, CI/CD pipeline working
- **Design cohesive** — Wabi-sabi aesthetic consistent throughout

---

## Critical Blockers (P0)

| Issue | Risk | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|
| Bundle size 594 KB (should be <250 KB) | Users on slow networks can't load | 2-3 days |
| No retry logic on API failures | Note data loss on flaky networks | 1-2 days |
| Test coverage ~5% | High regression risk | 2-3 days |
| Share tokens visible in browser history | Privacy concern | 4 hours |
| No offline editing (PWA gap) | Users can't use app without internet | 1-2 weeks |
| Mobile not tested on real devices | Unknown UX issues, can't claim cross-platform | 1-2 days |

> **Note:** Offline editing and mobile testing were elevated to P0 after reconciling with Mobile Strategy Analysis and Competitive Evaluation. See `docs/analysis/mobile-strategy-analysis-claude.md` for implementation approach.

### Details

**Bundle Size:**
- Main bundle: 593.87 KB gzip (165.72 KB compressed)
- Editor chunk: 414.91 KB gzip (127.80 KB compressed)
- Target: <250 KB gzip for main bundle
- Solutions: Tree-shake, lazy load routes (Changelog, Roadmap), lighter Tiptap config

**API Retry Logic:**
- Failed saves don't retry automatically
- Network flakiness could lose user's note content
- Need exponential backoff retry for critical operations

**Test Coverage:**
- Only 4 test files exist (sanitize, formatTime, ErrorBoundary, TagBadge)
- No tests for: note CRUD, auth flows, import/export, tags, sharing
- Minimum: Add 15-20 integration tests for critical paths

**Share Token Security:**
- Tokens appear in URL (browser history, shared links)
- Document this limitation to users
- Consider: copy-to-clipboard instead of URL display

---

## High Priority (P1)

| Issue | Risk | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|
| No rate limiting | Abuse/DOS vulnerability | 1 day |
| "Letting Go" doesn't auto-export backup | Users lose data on departure | 4 hours |
| Share expiration defaults to "never" | Permanent public shares | 2 hours |
| No session timeout | Security gap (logged in forever) | 4 hours |
| Image attachments not supported | Expected feature by users | 3-5 days |
| No feature discovery hints | Users miss slash commands, shortcuts | 2-3 days |

---

## Medium Priority (P2)

| Issue | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| No onboarding tutorial | Users discover features slowly |
| Empty library state basic | Could have better CTA |
| No help menu | Users might get stuck |
| PWA icons may be missing | Check /icons/ paths |
| No Lighthouse CI checks | No performance regression alerts |

---

## Timeline Estimates

| Scope | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| P0 fixes only | 2-3 weeks |
| P0 + P1 (recommended) | 3-4 weeks |
| Comprehensive (P0 + P1 + P2) | 5-6 weeks |

> **Updated:** Timeline extended after adding offline editing (1-2 weeks) and mobile testing (1-2 days) to P0 blockers. See Mobile Strategy Analysis for Enhanced PWA implementation plan.
