# Launch Readiness Assessment

**Author:** Claude (Opus 4.5)
**Date:** 2025-12-26
**Status:** Action Required

---

## Executive Summary

**Overall: ~75-80% Ready** — Solid foundation, but needs critical fixes before public launch.

**Recommendation:** CONDITIONAL GO after fixing P0 blockers and most P1 items.

---

## What's Strong

- **Core features complete** — CRUD, rich editor, tags, export/import, auth (email + OAuth), sharing
- **Good error handling** — Error boundary, toast notifications, network detection
- **Security fundamentals** — XSS prevention, RLS, password policies, input validation
- **Deployment ready** — Vercel + Supabase, CI/CD pipeline working
- **Design cohesive** — Wabi-sabi aesthetic consistent throughout

## Critical Blockers (P0)

| Issue | Risk | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|
| Bundle size 594 KB (should be <250 KB) | Users on slow networks can't load | 2-3 days |
| No retry logic on API failures | Note data loss on flaky networks | 1-2 days |
| Test coverage ~5% | High regression risk | 2-3 days |
| Share tokens visible in browser history | Privacy concern | 4 hours |
| No offline editing (PWA gap) | Users can't use app without internet | 1-2 weeks |
| Mobile not tested on real devices | Unknown UX issues, can't claim cross-platform | 1-2 days |

> **Note:** Offline editing and mobile testing were elevated to P0 after reconciling with Mobile Strategy Analysis and Competitive Evaluation. See `docs/analysis/mobile-strategy-analysis-claude.md` for implementation approach.

### Details

**Bundle Size:**
- Main bundle: 593.87 KB gzip (165.72 KB compressed)
- Editor chunk: 414.91 KB gzip (127.80 KB compressed)
- Target: <250 KB gzip for main bundle
- Solutions: Tree-shake, lazy load routes (Changelog, Roadmap), lighter Tiptap config

**API Retry Logic:**
- Failed saves don't retry automatically
- Network flakiness could lose user's note content
- Need exponential backoff retry for critical operations

**Test Coverage:**
- Only 4 test files exist (sanitize, formatTime, ErrorBoundary, TagBadge)
- No tests for: note CRUD, auth flows, import/export, tags, sharing
- Minimum: Add 15-20 integration tests for critical paths

**Share Token Security:**
- Tokens appear in URL (browser history, shared links)
- Document this limitation to users
- Consider: copy-to-clipboard instead of URL display

## High Priority (P1)

| Issue | Risk | Effort |
|-------|------|--------|
| No rate limiting | Abuse/DOS vulnerability | 1 day |
| "Letting Go" doesn't auto-export backup | Users lose data on departure | 4 hours |
| Share expiration defaults to "never" | Permanent public shares | 2 hours |
| No session timeout | Security gap (logged in forever) | 4 hours |
| Image attachments not supported | Expected feature by users | 3-5 days |
| No feature discovery hints | Users miss slash commands, shortcuts | 2-3 days |

---

## Medium Priority (P2)

| Issue | Notes |
|-------|-------|
| No onboarding tutorial | Users discover features slowly |
| Empty library state basic | Could have better CTA |
| No help menu | Users might get stuck |
| PWA icons may be missing | Check /icons/ paths |
| No Lighthouse CI checks | No performance regression alerts |

---

## Timeline Estimates

| Scope | Duration |
|-------|----------|
| P0 fixes only | 2-3 weeks |
| P0 + P1 (recommended) | 3-4 weeks |
| Comprehensive (P0 + P1 + P2) | 5-6 weeks |

> **Updated:** Timeline extended after adding offline editing (1-2 weeks) and mobile testing (1-2 days) to P0 blockers. See Mobile Strategy Analysis for Enhanced PWA implementation plan.

## Area-by-Area Assessment

| Area | Status | Blockers | Risk Level |
|------|--------|----------|------------|
| Core Functionality | Complete | 0 | Low |
| Error Handling | Adequate | 1 | Medium |
| Test Coverage | Critical Gap | 1 | High |
| Security | Good | 2 | Medium |
| Performance | Poor | 1 | High |
| Mobile UX | Untested | 1 | Medium |
| Onboarding | Functional | 0 | Low |
| Data Safety | Partial | 1 | Medium |
| Deployment | Ready | 0 | Low |

---

## Post-Launch Priorities (First 30 Days)

1. Monitor error rates via Sentry
2. Collect mobile device feedback
3. Increase test coverage to 50%
4. Further bundle optimization
5. Implement automated daily backups
6. Add feature usage analytics

---

## Success Metrics (Launch Week)

- <5% error rate on critical operations
- <2% abandonment on signup flow
- <10% users reporting bugs
- >95% notes saving within 2s
- <100ms p95 latency on note list load
