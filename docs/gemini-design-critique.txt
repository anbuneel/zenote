Based on the image you uploaded, you have successfully captured the **atmosphere** and **palette** of the "Temple & Forest" theme, but the layout structure has drifted back towards a standard "SaaS" (Software as a Service) look. It feels a bit too rigid and corporate compared to the organic "Wabi-Sabi" vision we discussed.

Here is a detailed breakdown of where you are aligned and where the design is deviating.

### 1. Strong Alignments (What you nailed)

* **The Palette ("Kintsugi"):** The background color (`#F9F8F6` or similar) and the card whiteness are perfect. It feels warm, tactile, and paper-like, completely avoiding the sterile white/blue of standard tech apps.
* **Typography:** You are correctly using the Serif font (**Cormorant Garamond**) for the headers ("Zenote," "Idhanth," "Ishya"). This gives it that literary, timeless temple feel.
* **The Accent Color:** The Terracotta/Rust color on the "New Note" button and the active tag dots is exactly right. It provides energy without being neon.
* **Minimalism:** The interface is clean. You haven't cluttered the cards with too many icons, which respects the "Invisible UI" ethos.

### 2. Deviations from "Wabi-Sabi" (Areas to Refine)

To bring this back to the "Zen" concept, we need to break the symmetry and rigidity.

**A. The "Clone" Problem (Uniformity vs. Imperfection)**
* **Current State:** All three cards (Idhanth, Ishya, Trading) are identical in width, height, and shape. They are lined up in a perfect soldier-like row.
* **The Zenote Vision:** Wabi-sabi celebrates asymmetry. In our design, we used a **Masonry Grid**.
* **The Fix:**
    * Allow cards to have different heights based on their content.
    * Don't align them in a single horizontal row; let them stack naturally (like Pinterest or a gallery wall).
    * *Subtle tweak:* Vary the border-radius slightly. In the code I gave you, one card had a sharp top-left, another a sharp bottom-right. Currently, your cards all have the same "leaf" shape (rounded top-right/bottom-left).

**B. The Navigation Bar (Corporate vs. Sanctuary)**
* **Current State:** You have a standard "New Note" primary button in the top right. This is classic web app design, but it adds visual weight to the top of the screen.
* **The Zenote Vision:** We moved the main action to a **Floating Action Button (FAB)** at the bottom center.
* **The Fix:** Remove the big orange button from the header. Move it to a floating orb or quill icon at the bottom of the screen. This opens up the header to be just about the brand and the search, making the app feel like a canvas, not a dashboard.

**C. The Filters (Buttons vs. River Stones)**
* **Current State:** The "All Notes" container looks like a boxy tab or a button with a drop shadow. The specific notes tags ("Idhanth", "Ishya") look like standard chips.
* **The Zenote Vision:** We wanted "River Stones."
* **The Fix:** Make the filter tags more organic.
    * Remove the square corners on the "All Notes" box.
    * Make them pill-shaped but slightly irregular.
    * Instead of a solid outline, perhaps use a subtle background fill that darkens on hover.

**D. Texture and Depth (Flat vs. Tactile)**
* **Current State:** The cards look fully opaque (solid white).
* **The Zenote Vision:** We aimed for **Glassmorphism** (frosted glass) or **Textured Paper**.
* **The Fix:**
    * If sticking to Light Mode: Add a very subtle noise texture to the background so it looks like handmade paper.
    * Try lowering the opacity of the cards to `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8)` and adding `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`. This allows the warmth of the background to bleed through slightly, making the notes feel like they are floating.

### Summary Recommendation

To get back to the "Novel UI" we designed:

1.  **Break the Grid:** Switch from a horizontal flex-row to a vertical masonry layout.
2.  **Move the Button:** Drop the "New Note" button to the bottom center (Floating Action Button).
3.  **Soften the Shapes:** Ensure the border radii vary slightly between cards to mimic organic uniqueness.
