# Quiet Intelligence: AI Feature Analysis for Yidhan

**Version:** 1.2
**Last Updated:** 2026-01-14
**Status:** Living Document (with finalized implementation decisions)
**Author:** Claude (Opus 4.5)

---

## Original Prompt

> What unique features can we add to Yidhan to differentiate it from other competitors? I was thinking of layering in "quiet intelligence" that uses Gen AI in the background to help users. What use cases / scenarios could we address?

---

## Executive Summary

This document proposes a comprehensive "Quiet Intelligence" feature layer for Yidhan — AI capabilities that run silently in the background to help users **remember what matters**, not generate more content. This positioning is unique in the note-taking landscape and aligns perfectly with Yidhan's wabi-sabi philosophy.

**Core differentiator:** While other apps use AI to help you write more, Yidhan uses AI to help you **reflect on what you've already written**.

---

## Strategic Context

### Existing Discussion

The `competitive-growth-plan-claude.md` established the foundation:
- **Positioning:** "Help me remember what matters" — not generate more content
- **Initial ideas:** Daily Whisper, Weekly Digest Email, pattern recognition
- **Philosophy:** Non-intrusive, reflective, surfaces YOUR words

### Competitive AI Landscape

| Competitor | AI Focus | User Need |
|------------|----------|-----------|
| Notion AI | "Help me write more" | Generation, summarization |
| Craft AI | "Help me write better" | Editing, expansion |
| Obsidian + plugins | "Help me search/query" | RAG, Q&A |
| Mem | "Help me organize" | Auto-tagging, search |
| **Yidhan (proposed)** | **"Help me remember"** | Proactive, gentle surfacing |

**The whitespace:** Nobody owns "reflective AI" — AI that helps you process what you've already written rather than produce more.

---

## Design Philosophy

All Quiet Intelligence features must follow these principles:

| Principle | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Background operation** | No manual triggers required; AI works silently |
| **Gentle surfacing** | Never intrusive; always optional to view |
| **Your words** | Uses quotes and phrases from user's own notes |
| **Respects silence** | If nothing meaningful to say, says nothing |
| **Wabi-sabi alignment** | Embraces impermanence, absence, natural rhythms |
| **Dismissable** | User can always decline, hide, or disable |

**Brand language options:**
- "Gentle Memory" — The app remembers what you meant to do
- "Quiet Companion" — A presence that notices without interrupting
- "Whispers" — Soft observations from your own writing

## Feature Details

### 1. Daily Whisper (Existing Concept)

**Category:** Engagement / Delight

**Scenario:** User opens Yidhan in the morning. Instead of a blank library, they see a gentle greeting.

**Experience:**
> *"Because you've been writing about focus lately..."*
>
> *"The ability to simplify means to eliminate the unnecessary so that the necessary may speak." — Hans Hofmann*

**Why It Works:**
- Makes the app feel alive, not utilitarian
- Personalized to user's actual interests
- Starts the session with positivity
- Gives users a reason to open the app even when not writing

**Implementation:**
- Analyze recent note themes via topic modeling
- Match to curated quote database by category
- Show as subtle banner on library view
- Dismissable, non-blocking

**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** High | **Tier:** Free (retention driver)

---

### 2. Weekly Digest Email (Existing Concept)

**Category:** Engagement / Retention

**Scenario:** User receives a weekly email summarizing their writing activity and surfacing insights.

**Experience:**
> **Subject:** Your week in words — January 8-14
>
> *You wrote 4 notes this week, mostly about the new project launch.*
>
> **Things you mentioned wanting to do:**
> - "Follow up with the design team"
> - "Research competitor pricing"
>
> **A thread through your notes:**
> *You've mentioned "deadline pressure" in 3 notes. Take a breath.*
>
> **This time last year:**
> *You were planning your garden. "I want to try growing tomatoes this year."*

**Why It Works:**
- Non-intrusive (email, not push notification)
- Extracts actionable items without forcing to-do methodology
- Surfaces patterns user might not notice
- Keeps users engaged even when not in-app

**Implementation:**
- Weekly batch job analyzing recent notes
- Intent extraction for "want to" / "should" / "need to" phrases
- Topic clustering for pattern detection
- Optional — user can enable/disable

**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** High | **Tier:** Free (acquisition driver)

---

### 3. Resonance Threads (Connecting the Dots)

**Category:** Connection / Discovery

**Scenario:** User writes about "anxiety about the presentation" in January, then writes about "nervous about the talk" in March. They never searched for it or tagged it.

**Experience:**
> *"A thread runs through your notes..."*
>
> *You've reflected on presentations 4 times since January. Here's what you said:*
>
> - Jan 15: "The presentation is next week and I can't stop thinking about it"
> - Feb 2: "Survived the demo. It actually went better than expected"
> - Mar 10: "Another talk coming up. Why does this still make me nervous?"

**Why It's Unique:**
- Not search (user didn't ask)
- Not tagging (user didn't organize)
- **Proactive connection** of thoughts across time
- Like a thoughtful friend who remembers what you've said

**Implementation:**
- Semantic embedding of all notes
- Clustering by topic/theme over time
- Surface when cluster reaches significance threshold
- Show in dedicated "Threads" section or on relevant note view

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** Very High | **Tier:** Bloom

---

### 4. The Quiet Reminder (Unfinished Intentions)

**Category:** Intention / Follow-through

**Scenario:** User wrote "I should really call Dad more often" 3 weeks ago. It wasn't a task list. Just a passing thought.

**Experience:**
> *"Three weeks ago, you wrote:"*
>
> *"I should really call Dad more often. We haven't talked since Christmas."*
>
> *Does that still feel important?*
>
> [Yes, remind me] [Let it fade]

**Why It's Unique:**
- **No to-do list required** — extracts intentions from natural writing
- Non-judgmental ("does that still feel important?" vs "you haven't done this")
- Respects that some intentions naturally fade
- Surfaces the implicit, not just the explicit

**Implementation:**
- NER + intent classification for "I should," "I want to," "need to," "remind me to"
- Time-delayed surfacing (1-4 weeks after writing)
- User can snooze, dismiss, or mark complete
- Never nags — one gentle prompt per intention

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Tier:** Bloom

---

### 5. Seasonal Echo (This Time Last Year)

**Category:** Reflection / Memory

**Scenario:** User has been using Yidhan for over a year. It's March 15th. A year ago, they wrote about starting their garden.

**Experience:**
> *"A year ago today, you wrote:"*
>
> *"Finally bought the tomato seedlings. I've never grown anything before but something about this spring feels right for trying."*
>
> [View full note]

**Why It's Unique:**
- Like "On This Day" but for **your own reflections**, not photos
- Surfaces moments of significance YOU captured
- Encourages **long-term relationship** with the app
- Deeply personal and often emotional

**Implementation:**
- Date-based retrieval (±3 days for flexibility)
- Semantic filtering to surface significant entries (not "bought groceries")
- Significance score based on length, emotional content, uniqueness
- Show on app open or in weekly digest

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Tier:** Bloom

---

### 6. The Fading Whisper (Notes Ready to Let Go)

**Category:** Declutter / Mindfulness

**Scenario:** A note titled "Conference planning 2024" hasn't been touched in 8 months. It's just sitting in the archive, cluttering space.

**Experience:**
> *"This note from last June hasn't been opened since."*
>
> *"Conference planning 2024 — session ideas, speaker contacts..."*
>
> *Does it still serve you, or is it ready to fade?*
>
> [Keep it] [Let it fade]

**Why It's Unique:**
- Aligns perfectly with **"Letting Go" philosophy**
- Proactive decluttering that **respects the user**
- Not "storage limit reached" — it's about **mindfulness**
- Helps notes naturally "compost" over time
- Connects to existing Faded Notes feature

**Implementation:**
- Access pattern analysis (last opened, last edited)
- Staleness threshold (e.g., 6+ months untouched)
- Periodic gentle prompts (monthly review)
- "Let it fade" moves to Faded Notes with accelerated expiry

**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** Medium | **Tier:** Free (philosophy alignment)

---

### 7. The Unsaid (Noticing What's Missing)

**Category:** Awareness / Pattern Detection

**Scenario:** User used to write about "morning runs" frequently — 3-4 times a month for 6 months. They haven't mentioned it in 2+ months.

**Experience:**
> *"A rhythm seems to have paused..."*
>
> *You used to write about your morning runs — 12 times between April and September. You haven't mentioned them since.*
>
> *Life changes. Just noticing.*

**Why It's Unique:**
- Most AI focuses on **what's there**; this notices **what's absent**
- Surfaces life changes without judgment
- Could prompt reflection ("did I stop on purpose?") or awareness of drift
- Very **wabi-sabi** — noticing absence, impermanence, change
- No other app does this

**Implementation:**
- Topic frequency analysis over rolling time windows
- Detect statistically significant drops in recurring themes
- Minimum frequency threshold (must have been mentioned 5+ times)
- Gentle, non-judgmental language always

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** Medium | **Tier:** Bloom

---

### 8. Quiet Questions (Reflection Prompts from Your Words)

**Category:** Reflection / Journaling

**Scenario:** User has been writing about "work-life balance" in various forms across several notes without explicitly calling it that.

**Experience:**
> *"A question from your notes..."*
>
> *You've written about "finding balance" several times lately — between work and rest, ambition and peace.*
>
> *What does balance look like for you right now?*
>
> [Write about this] [Not now]

**Why It's Unique:**
- **NOT generic prompts** ("What are you grateful for?")
- Personalized to YOUR themes and YOUR language
- Encourages deeper reflection on topics you're already processing
- Could appear daily, weekly, or on demand
- Turns the app into a reflective writing partner

**Implementation:**
- Topic clustering across recent notes
- Question generation using user's own vocabulary
- Curated question templates by theme category
- Optional — can enable "reflection mode" in settings

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Tier:** Bloom

---

### 9. The Convergence (When Multiple Themes Align)

**Category:** Insight / Synthesis

**Scenario:** User has written separately about "thinking about a career change," "maybe moving to a new city," and "feeling uncertain about the future." Three different notes, not explicitly connected.

**Experience:**
> *"A convergence in your notes..."*
>
> *Several recent notes touch on transitions:*
> - Career: "Maybe it's time for something new"
> - Place: "I keep looking at apartments in Portland"
> - Feeling: "Everything feels uncertain right now"
>
> *A season of change?*

**Why It's Unique:**
- **Synthesizes across notes** without user effort
- Helps user see patterns they might not notice
- Not search, not summary — it's **insight**
- Like a therapist noticing themes in what you're saying
- Creates "aha" moments

**Implementation:**
- Multi-topic co-occurrence analysis
- Identify semantic clusters forming across recent notes (2-4 week window)
- Minimum 3 notes touching related themes
- Human-readable synthesis with quotes

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** Very High | **Tier:** Bloom

---

### 10. Gentle Grounding (Emotional Tone Awareness)

**Category:** Emotional / Wellness

**Scenario:** The AI notices a shift in tone across recent notes — more anxious language, shorter notes, more mentions of stress, fewer reflections.

**Experience:**
> *"A gentle observation..."*
>
> *Your recent notes feel a bit heavier than usual. More urgency, less space.*
>
> *Would you like a moment to breathe?*
>
> [Take a breath] [I'm okay]

If they choose "Take a breath" → Simple 60-second breathing exercise or nature soundscape.

**Why It's Unique:**
- **Emotional intelligence**, not productivity optimization
- Non-diagnostic ("feel heavier" not "you seem depressed")
- Checks in without being intrusive
- Could be the only app that **notices how you're doing**
- Respects user agency — never prescriptive

**Implementation:**
- Sentiment analysis across recent notes
- Linguistic marker detection (negative emotion words, urgency, shortened length)
- Comparison to user's baseline over time
- Very careful, gentle language — never clinical

**Effort:** High | **Impact:** Medium | **Tier:** Bloom

---

### 11. Letter to Future Self (Time Capsules)

**Category:** Time Capsule / Delight

**Scenario:** User writes a note and chooses to "send it to future me" — 1 month, 6 months, or 1 year from now. They forget about it.

**Experience (6 months later):**
> *"A letter from past you..."*
>
> *Six months ago, on a summer evening, you wrote this and asked to receive it today:*
>
> *"I hope you figured out the job situation. I hope you're less stressed. I hope you remember that you were trying really hard right now and it's okay if things aren't perfect yet."*
>
> [Read full note] [Write a response]

**Why It's Unique:**
- Creates **intentional time capsules**
- User-initiated but AI-delivered
- Builds anticipation and long-term engagement
- Deeply personal and often emotional
- "Write a response" creates a dialogue with past self

**Implementation:**
- "Send to future me" button in editor
- Delivery date picker (1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, custom)
- Scheduled delivery system
- Email notification + in-app display

**Effort:** Low | **Impact:** Medium | **Tier:** Free (delight/retention)

---

### 12. Whispered Summary (Welcome Back After Absence)

**Category:** Re-engagement / Onboarding

**Scenario:** User hasn't opened Yidhan in 2 weeks. Life got busy. They return and feel disoriented — "where was I?"

**Experience:**
> *"While you were away, your notes rested."*
>
> *Here's a whisper of where you left off:*
>
> *You were mostly writing about the **product launch** — 4 notes over your last week. The last thing you wrote: "Need to finalize the pricing page before Monday."*
>
> *Your most recent notes:*
> - Launch prep thoughts (Jan 2)
> - Meeting notes — design review (Jan 1)
> - New year intentions (Dec 31)
>
> [Continue where you left off]

**Why It's Unique:**
- Makes **return feel welcoming**, not overwhelming
- Acknowledges the gap without judgment ("rested" not "abandoned")
- Re-orients the user gently
- Reduces friction of "wait, where was I?"
- Increases likelihood of re-engagement after dormancy

**Implementation:**
- Inactivity detection (7+ days since last session)
- Summarization of last active period
- Context-aware display on return (not shown if recent user)
- Graceful fallback if no recent activity to summarize

**Effort:** Medium | **Impact:** High | **Tier:** Bloom

### Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Options | Recommendation |
|----------|---------|----------------|
| Embedding model | OpenAI, Cohere, local | OpenAI text-embedding-3-small (cost-effective) |
| Processing | Real-time vs batch | Batch (nightly job) for most features |
| Storage | Embeddings in Supabase | pgvector extension for similarity search |
| Email | SendGrid, Resend, Postmark | Resend (developer-friendly, good deliverability) |
| LLM for synthesis | GPT-4, Claude, Gemini | Claude (aligns with calm, thoughtful tone) |

### Privacy Considerations

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| Note content sent to AI | Process embeddings locally where possible; clear data retention policy |
| Emotional analysis | Strictly opt-in; no data shared externally; user can view/delete analysis |
| Pattern detection | All insights derived from user's own notes; no cross-user analysis |
| Email digests | User controls frequency; one-click unsubscribe; no tracking pixels |

## Appendix A: The Quiet Reminder — Deep Dive

This appendix provides detailed implementation analysis for the Quiet Reminder feature, which extracts **implicit intentions** from natural writing.

### A.1 Core Concept

**Traditional to-do apps:** User explicitly creates a task → app nags until done

**Quiet Reminder:** User writes naturally → AI detects implicit intentions → gently surfaces them later → user decides if still relevant

The key insight: **People write about things they want to do without making to-do lists.**

### A.2 What Qualifies as an "Intention"?

Not every sentence is an intention. The AI looks for specific linguistic patterns:

| Pattern | Example | Confidence |
|---------|---------|------------|
| "I should..." | "I should call Mom this weekend" | High |
| "I need to..." | "I need to finish that report" | High |
| "I want to..." | "I want to start journaling more" | Medium |
| "I have to..." | "I have to remember to cancel that subscription" | High |
| "Remind me to..." | "Remind me to buy flowers for the anniversary" | Very High |
| "Don't forget..." | "Don't forget to email the contractor" | Very High |
| "Maybe I'll..." | "Maybe I'll try that new restaurant" | Low |
| "I've been meaning to..." | "I've been meaning to organize the garage" | High |

**What it ignores:**
- Past tense: "I should have called Mom" (already happened/regret)
- Hypotheticals: "If I had time, I should..." (not a real intention)
- Negatives: "I shouldn't eat so much sugar" (not actionable in the same way)

### A.3 Extraction Flow

### A.4 When Does It Surface?

**Timing rules:**

| Scenario | Surface After |
|----------|---------------|
| No deadline hint | 2-3 weeks after writing |
| Has deadline hint | ~50% of time until deadline |
| "Remind me to..." (explicit) | 1 week after writing |
| User hasn't opened app in 7+ days | Include in "welcome back" |

**Where it appears:**

1. **In-app (subtle banner)** — When user opens the library
2. **Weekly digest email** — "Things you mentioned wanting to do"
3. **Dedicated "Quiet Tasks" view** — Optional screen showing all pending

### A.5 The UX Interaction

When surfaced, it looks like this:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                                                              │

│  │   that freelance project he mentioned."                 │ │
│  │                                                         │ │
│  │  Does that still feel important?                        │ │
│  │                                                         │ │
│  │  ┌──────────────┐  ┌──────────────┐  ┌────────────┐    │ │

│  │  │              │  │   later      │  │            │    │ │
│  │  └──────────────┘  └──────────────┘  └────────────┘    │ │
│  │                                                         │ │

│                                                              │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**The three responses:**

| Response | What Happens |
|----------|--------------|
| **Done ✓** | Marked complete. Never shown again. Optional: "Would you like to write about how it went?" |
| **Remind me later** | Snoozed for 1 week. Surfaces again once. |
| **Let it fade** | Dismissed permanently. No judgment. Some intentions naturally pass. |

### A.6 What Makes This Different from To-Do Apps?

| Aspect | Traditional To-Do | Quiet Reminder |
|--------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Creation** | User explicitly adds task | AI extracts from natural writing |
| **Tone** | "You have 5 overdue tasks!" | "Does this still feel important?" |
| **Persistence** | Nags until done | Surfaces once, then fades if ignored |
| **Failure** | Guilt when incomplete | "Let it fade" is a valid outcome |
| **Philosophy** | Productivity optimization | Mindful awareness |

### A.7 Technical Implementation

```typescript
// Types
interface Intention {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  sourceNoteId: string;
  text: string;                    // The extracted intention
  originalSentence: string;        // Full sentence for context
  triggerPhrase: string;           // "I should", "need to", etc.
  confidence: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'very_high';
  deadlineHint: string | null;     // "April", "next week", etc.
  extractedAt: Date;
  surfaceAfter: Date;
  status: 'pending' | 'surfaced' | 'done' | 'snoozed' | 'faded';
  snoozedUntil: Date | null;
}

// Extraction patterns (simplified)
const INTENTION_PATTERNS = [
  { regex: /I should\s+(.+?)(?:\.|$)/gi, confidence: 'high' },
  { regex: /I need to\s+(.+?)(?:\.|$)/gi, confidence: 'high' },
  { regex: /I have to\s+(.+?)(?:\.|$)/gi, confidence: 'high' },
  { regex: /remind me to\s+(.+?)(?:\.|$)/gi, confidence: 'very_high' },
  { regex: /don'?t forget to\s+(.+?)(?:\.|$)/gi, confidence: 'very_high' },
  { regex: /I want to\s+(.+?)(?:\.|$)/gi, confidence: 'medium' },
  { regex: /I'?ve been meaning to\s+(.+?)(?:\.|$)/gi, confidence: 'high' },
];

// Could run client-side or as a background job
function extractIntentions(noteContent: string, noteId: string): Intention[] {
  const plainText = htmlToPlainText(noteContent);
  const intentions: Intention[] = [];

  for (const pattern of INTENTION_PATTERNS) {
    const matches = plainText.matchAll(pattern.regex);
    for (const match of matches) {
      intentions.push({
        id: generateId(),
        sourceNoteId: noteId,
        text: match[1].trim(),
        originalSentence: match[0],
        triggerPhrase: match[0].split(/\s+/).slice(0, 3).join(' '),
        confidence: pattern.confidence,
        deadlineHint: extractDeadlineHint(match[1]),
        extractedAt: new Date(),
        surfaceAfter: calculateSurfaceDate(pattern.confidence, match[1]),
        status: 'pending',
        // ...
      });
    }
  }

  return intentions;
}
```

### A.8 Edge Cases & Mitigations

| Concern | Mitigation |
|---------|------------|
| **Feels surveillance-y** | Clear opt-in. User can see all extracted intentions. Delete button. |
| **Too many intentions** | Limit to 3 surfaced per week. Prioritize by confidence & recency. |
| **Extracts wrong things** | "This doesn't look right" feedback button. Learns from corrections. |
| **Sensitive content** | Never surface intentions about health, relationships, finances in email. In-app only. |
| **User already did it** | "Already done? Tap here to mark complete without the reminder." |

## Appendix B: Quiet Tasks — Unified Task System

This appendix expands the Quiet Reminder concept into a complete task awareness system that handles **both explicit tasks and implicit intentions**.

### B.1 The Problem

Users create to-do lists and reminders in their notes but don't add dates/deadlines — and then forget about them. The tasks get buried across multiple notes.

### B.2 Two Types of "Things to Remember"

| Type | Example | Detection | Current Problem |
|------|---------|-----------|-----------------|
| **Implicit Intentions** | "I should call Mom" | AI extracts from prose | Never tracked at all |
| **Explicit Tasks** | "- [ ] Call the dentist" | User wrote a checkbox/list | Written but buried and forgotten |

Yidhan already has task lists via Tiptap checkboxes. The problem isn't *writing* tasks — it's **losing track of them** across multiple notes.

### B.5 Smart Timing Without Deadlines

Since users often don't add dates — here's the smart timing logic:

| Signal | Surfacing Behavior |
|--------|-------------------|
| **Age** | Older uncompleted tasks bubble up ("resting longest") |
| **Note recency** | If you edited the note recently but didn't check the task, it's probably still relevant |
| **Note staleness** | If you haven't touched the note in 30+ days, maybe the whole context has passed |
| **Explicit deadline hint** | "before April", "next week" → surfaces earlier |
| **Task type** | Explicit checkboxes get priority over extracted intentions |

**The algorithm (simplified):**

```
Priority Score =
  (days_since_created × 1.5) +           // Older = more urgent
  (is_explicit_checkbox ? 10 : 0) +      // Checkboxes > prose
  (has_deadline_hint ? 20 : 0) +         // Deadline hints matter
  (note_recently_edited ? 5 : 0) -       // Recent note = still relevant
  (times_snoozed × 3)                    // Snoozed = less urgent
```

### B.6 Weekly Digest Integration

The weekly email becomes more powerful with Quiet Tasks:

```
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  Your week in words — January 13-20

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  📝 You wrote 6 notes this week, mostly about project planning.

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ⏳ TASKS RESTING LONGEST

  These have been waiting a while. Still important?

  ○ Call the dentist (3 weeks)
    from "Health notes"

  ○ Review the contract (2 weeks)
    from "Work - Project X"

  ○ Cancel gym membership (2 weeks)
    from "Budget planning"

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  💭 INTENTIONS YOU MENTIONED

  Things you wrote about wanting to do:

  ○ "I should reach out to Sarah's brother about that
     freelance project" (5 days ago)

  ○ "Need to renew my passport before April" (1 week ago)

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  ✓ COMPLETED THIS WEEK

  ✓ Buy groceries
  ✓ Schedule team sync
  ✓ Send meeting notes

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

  [View all tasks in Yidhan]

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
```

### B.7 Two-Way Sync with Notes

When you check off a task in the Quiet Tasks view, it should sync back to the original note:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                     TWO-WAY SYNC                            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│                                                             │
│  In Note "Health notes":              Quiet Tasks View:     │
│  ┌─────────────────────┐              ┌─────────────────┐   │
│  │ - [ ] Call dentist  │  ◄────────►  │ ○ Call dentist  │   │
│  │ - [x] Buy vitamins  │              │ ✓ Buy vitamins  │   │
│  └─────────────────────┘              └─────────────────┘   │
│                                                             │
│  Check it off in either place → syncs to both               │
│                                                             │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**For extracted intentions** (no checkbox in original note):
- Marking "Done" in Quiet Tasks just marks it complete in the task system
- Optionally: "Would you like to add a note about this?" → appends to original note

### B.8 The "Let It Fade" Philosophy

This is NOT a productivity app. The philosophy:

| Traditional To-Do | Quiet Tasks |
|-------------------|-------------|
| "5 overdue tasks!" | "3 tasks resting longest" |
| Guilt for incomplete | "Let it fade" is valid |
| Must check off everything | Some things naturally pass |
| Red badges, notifications | Calm weekly summary |
| Tasks are obligations | Tasks are intentions |

**"Let it fade" scenarios:**
- You wrote "call the contractor" but you moved and it's irrelevant now
- You listed "research vacation destinations" but plans changed
- The context of the task no longer exists

> *"Not everything you write down needs to be done. Some thoughts are just passing through. Quiet Tasks helps you notice what's been resting — you decide what still matters."*

This reframes task management as **awareness** rather than **accountability**.

### B.9 Database Schema

```sql
-- Tasks/intentions extracted from notes
create table note_tasks (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  user_id uuid references auth.users(id) on delete cascade not null,
  source_note_id uuid references notes(id) on delete cascade not null,

  -- Task content
  text text not null,
  original_sentence text,  -- For intentions, the full sentence

  -- Classification
  type text not null check (type in ('explicit_checkbox', 'explicit_text', 'implicit_intention')),
  trigger_phrase text,  -- "I should", "TODO:", etc.
  confidence text check (confidence in ('low', 'medium', 'high', 'very_high')),

  -- Timing
  deadline_hint text,  -- "April", "next week", etc.
  created_at timestamptz default now() not null,
  surface_after timestamptz,

  -- Status
  status text not null default 'pending' check (status in ('pending', 'done', 'snoozed', 'faded')),
  snoozed_until timestamptz,
  completed_at timestamptz,

  -- Prevent duplicates
  unique(source_note_id, text)
);

-- RLS: Users can only see their own tasks
alter table note_tasks enable row level security;
create policy "Users can manage own tasks" on note_tasks
  for all using (auth.uid() = user_id);
```

### B.10 Implementation Phases

| Phase | What It Does | Complexity | Value |
|-------|--------------|------------|-------|
| **Phase 1: Task Aggregation** | Collect all Tiptap checkboxes across notes | Low | High |
| **Phase 2: Task-like Text** | Detect "TODO:", "REMINDER:", etc. | Low | Medium |
| **Phase 3: Intention Extraction** | Find "I should...", "need to..." | Medium | High |
| **Phase 4: Smart Surfacing** | Age-based priority without deadlines | Medium | High |
| **Phase 5: Two-way Sync** | Check off in view → updates note | Medium | Medium |
| **Phase 6: Weekly Digest** | Email summary of resting tasks | Low | High |

### B.11 UI Entry Points

Where does "Quiet Tasks" live in the app?

**Option A: Profile menu item (recommended)**
```
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 👤 Your Name        │
├─────────────────────┤
│ ⚙️ Settings         │
│ 📋 Quiet Tasks  (3) │  ← Badge shows pending count
│ 🌅 Faded Notes      │
│ 📤 Export           │
│ 🚪 Sign out         │
└─────────────────────┘
```

**Option B: Footer link (like Faded Notes)**
```
Changelog · Roadmap · Tasks · Shortcuts · GitHub
```

**Option C: Keyboard shortcut**
- `Cmd/Ctrl + T` → Open Quiet Tasks view

### B.12 Key Insight

> **You don't need deadlines if the system surfaces by age.** The longer something sits unchecked, the more it bubbles up — either you do it, or you consciously let it fade.

## Appendix C: Implementation Decisions (Finalized)

These decisions were finalized on 2026-01-14 for the Quiet Reminder MVP.

### Technical Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Processing location** | Client-side (regex) | Privacy-first; no note content sent to server. Can add LLM later for edge cases. |
| **When to extract** | Batch (background) | Avoid adding latency to note saves. Run periodically (e.g., on app load, daily). |
| **Storage** | Supabase `note_tasks` table | Enables cross-device sync and future email digest feature. |
| **LLM usage** | Start with regex only | Regex handles 80% of patterns. Graduate to LLM for ambiguous cases later. |

### UX Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Default behavior** | Opt-in | New feature, safer to let users discover and enable. Can flip to opt-out once validated. |
| **Opt-in storage** | `user_metadata.quiet_tasks_enabled` | Reuses existing Supabase auth pattern (like `full_name`). |
| **Initial surfacing** | Dedicated "Quiet Tasks" view | Self-contained, testable. Add in-app banner and email later. |
| **Surfacing frequency** | Max 3 per week | Avoid feeling naggy. Quality over quantity. |
| **Surface timing** | After 2 weeks (no deadline) | Gives user time to naturally complete before surfacing. |
| **Deadline hints** | Surface at ~50% of time until deadline | "before April" written in Jan → surface mid-Feb. |

### Behavior Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Snooze duration** | 1 week | Long enough to be useful, short enough to resurface. |
| **Max snoozes** | 2 times | After 2 snoozes, suggest "let it fade" more prominently. |
| **Auto-fade threshold** | 90 days untouched | Very old intentions auto-fade with notification. |
| **Completed visibility** | 7 days | Show "Completed Recently" for 1 week, then archive. |

### Privacy Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Sensitive topics in email** | Never | Health, medical, relationships, finances, legal — in-app only. |
| **User control** | Full visibility + delete | User can view ALL extracted intentions and delete any. |
| **Transparency** | Show trigger phrase | Display "Extracted from: I should..." so user understands why. |

### Settings UI Location

The opt-in toggle will be added to the Settings modal as a new "Intelligence" tab:

```
Settings Modal
├── Profile (existing)
├── Password (existing)
└── Intelligence (new)
    └── Quiet Tasks toggle
        └── "Surface intentions from your writing"
        └── [Off] [On]
```

### Scope Decision

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **Include explicit checkboxes?** | Yes — include in MVP | Unified view is more useful. Users get one place to see ALL tasks. |

The Quiet Tasks view will show **both**:
1. **Explicit tasks** — Tiptap checkboxes (`- [ ] Call dentist`) aggregated from all notes
2. **Implicit intentions** — AI-extracted from prose (`"I should call Mom"`)

Each task type will be visually distinguished:
- Explicit: No indicator needed (user wrote it as a task)
- Implicit: Shows `💭 Extracted from: "I should..."` for transparency

### Monetization Decision

| Decision | Choice | Rationale |
|----------|--------|-----------|
| **MVP pricing** | Free for all users | Experimenting — validate feature value before gating |
| **Future pricing** | Bloom tier ($4/mo) | Gate behind premium once validated |
| **Gating approach** | Soft prompts, not hard walls | Aligns with "calm monetization" philosophy |

See [subscription-architecture-claude.md](subscription-architecture-claude.md) for detailed payment/gating architecture (to be implemented post-MVP).

### Open Questions (Deferred)

These questions are deferred to future iterations:

| Question | Status |
|----------|--------|
| **Weekly email digest** | Deferred — requires email infrastructure |
| **In-app banner surfacing** | Deferred — start with dedicated view only |
| **Two-way checkbox sync** | Deferred — checking off in Quiet Tasks updates original note |
| **Premium feature gating** | Deferred — MVP is free; add gating after validation |
