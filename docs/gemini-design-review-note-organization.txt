Critical Feedback & Refinements for "Chapters"
While the plan is solid, here are three specific refinements to ensure it hits the quality bar of the rest of the app:

A. The "Empty State" Problem

Risk: If I haven't written anything in 3 days, "Today" is empty. Does the header disappear? If I have gaps in my writing habit, the timeline might look broken.

Refinement: Do not render empty chapters. If "Today" is empty, start with "This Week." The interface should be honest about the content, not a template waiting to be filled.

B. The "Masonry" Conflict

Risk: Masonry grids rely on vertical stacking. If "Today" has only 1 note and "This Week" has 5, how do they transition? A hard horizontal line breaks the masonry flow.

Refinement: Use "Soft Breaks." Instead of a full-width rigid divider line (<hr>), use the sticky header on the left margin (or center) and let the masonry grid continue flowing, but push the cards for that section down.

Alternatively: Accept that each Chapter is a separate masonry grid container. This is easier to code but might leave jagged white space at the bottom of "Today" if you have an odd number of notes.

C. The Sidebar Navigation (The "Dot" Nav)

Risk: On mobile, this will be unusable (too small, no hover).

Refinement:

Desktop: The dots are perfect.

Mobile: Replace the dots with a "Time Scrubber" pill at the bottom (like the photo scroll bar on iOS). Slide your thumb to jump between months/eras.
