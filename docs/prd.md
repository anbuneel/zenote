## Executive Summary

Zenote is a calm, distraction-free note-taking application inspired by Japanese stationery, Muji aesthetics, and architectural journals. It provides a "wabi-sabi" design philosophy with asymmetric card corners, warm colors, and elegant typography, creating a peaceful digital space for thought capture and reflection.

## Product Vision

> *A quiet space for your mind.*

Zenote aims to be the antithesis of feature-bloated productivity tools. Where other apps compete on features, Zenote competes on restraint. The goal is to provide a digital notebook that feels as natural and unobtrusive as a well-worn Moleskine journal.

### Design Philosophy

| Principle | Implementation |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Wabi-Sabi** | Embrace imperfection through asymmetric corners (2px 24px 4px 24px) |
| **Calm Technology** | Muted color palette, no notifications, no gamification |
| **Honest Presence** | Empty states are not hidden; chapters without notes don't render |
| **Organic Language** | "Faded Notes" instead of "Trash", "Release" instead of "Delete" |
