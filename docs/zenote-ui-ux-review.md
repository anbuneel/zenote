=======================================
1. Executive Summary  
Zenote largely succeeds in feeling Zen rather than generic: the typography-led hierarchy, restrained palette, and soft card geometry create a calm reading environment. The experience reads as �quiet� on both the landing and editor screens, with minimal UI chrome and strong focus on content. The library view, however, edges toward visual busyness due to dense tag pills, multiple controls, and card density. Overall, it�s close to a flow-state app, but a few high-contrast accents and clustered controls interrupt that tranquility.

2. Strengths (Zen Alignment)  
- Landing hero uses generous Ma: the large headline with deep surrounding space and faint background texture creates true breathing room.  
- Editor typography hierarchy is clear: oversized title, subtle meta, and large body copy support long-form reading with low cognitive load.  
- Card corners, soft shadows, and muted gold accent create Kanso-friendly structure without heavy borders or dividers.

3. Friction Points & �Anti-Patterns�  
High  
- Concept drift in Library: the top bar (search, tag pills, new note, theme toggle, avatar) + dense masonry cards reads like a standard productivity dashboard. The calm �no folder� premise feels diluted by multiple simultaneous control clusters.  
- Visual noise from repeated pills and badges: each card has tag chips and timestamps; the repeated chroma draws attention away from titles.

Medium  
- No-folder UX clarity: �All Notes� + multiple tag filters + search lacks a clear primary path for retrieval. It feels like a folder substitute rather than a new mental model.  
- Contrast and eye strain: the gold accents on dark green are bright and frequent (buttons, pins, badges), creating focal competition.

Low  
- Motion/feedback cues aren�t visible in stills, but the density implies potential �busy� transitions. If animations are quick or frequent, they may undermine Seijaku.

4. Actionable Refinements  
- Reduce control clustering in the library header: move tag filters into a single �Filter� control or collapsible rail so search becomes the primary, calm entry point.  
- Tone down accent frequency: keep gold for primary action only; shift pin/badge chips to a muted green-gray to lower visual noise.  
- Increase card spacing slightly and reduce card density by one column at common widths to restore Ma in the grid.  
- Increase editor body line-height (e.g., from ~1.45 to ~1.6) and slightly soften body text color to reduce eye strain over long reads.  
- Clarify �no folder� narrative with gentle chronological cues: stronger �Today / This Week / Older� separators or a subtle vertical rhythm cue to reinforce a natural retrieval path without tags.
